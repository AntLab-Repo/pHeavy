This repository contains the source code for our paper published on TNSM: "pHeavy: Predicting Heavy Flows in the Programmable Data Plane". The core is written by P4_16 running in programmable switches (Tofino AISC).

The Tofino-version code implements the prediction of TCP traffic via optional features (e.g., TCP flgas, packet length and port) and memory management via registers.
